# Weather Dashboard ![Top Language Badge](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/MrCartree/weather-dashboard)

Weather Dashboard is a sight dedicated to pulling weather information from a specific city for the current day as well as a forecast for the next five days.

Used skeleton css which can be found [here](http://getskeleton.com/) and I pulled the cdn for skeleton css [here](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/skeleton)
Favicon pulled from google images.
I used [this](https://coderrocketfuel.com/article/convert-a-unix-timestamp-to-a-date-in-vanilla-javascript) site to help convert unix time to a regular timestamp.

This site is deployed [here]()
